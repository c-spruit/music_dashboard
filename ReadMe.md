# Music Dashboard ReadMe

**Intro & Aims**

This project aims to help music lovers find songs and DJs they are interested in. By applying filters users can create a specific selection of songs, view the results via various graphics and create a Spotify playlist.   

**Data**

A database of tracks has been created by scraping tracklists from various online sources.  

**The Dashboard**

Currently users can interpret their selection of songs via a WordCloud graphic, histograms for select features of the tracks and a table listing a random sample of 20 tracks can also be viewed. The dashbaord has been created using Dash and is hosted using Heroku.
