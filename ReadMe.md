**Intro & Aims**

This project aims to help music lovers find songs they are interested in via an interactive dashboard. By applying filters users can create a specific selection of songs, view the results via various graphics and create a Spotify playlist.   

View the dashboard: https://music-dashi.herokuapp.com/

**Data**

A database of tracks has been created by scraping tracklists from various online sources and querying the Spotify API.  

**The Dashboard**

Currently users can view their selection of songs via a WordCloud graphic, histograms for select features and a table listing a random sample of 20 of the selected tracks. The dashboard has been created using Dash and is hosted using Heroku. 

**Future Features**

- Create a Spotify playlist from your selected tracks
- Perform clustering to help identify groups of tracks
- Recommend DJs/Mixes based on a users music preferences
